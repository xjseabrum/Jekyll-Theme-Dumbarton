Some documentation:

The following folder is generated automatically and probably shouldn't be edited
_site/

To edit actual page sites go to this folder:
pages/

To alter the information contained in the top bar (across all pages) edit the following:
_data/nav.yml

The information contained in the lower bar on the home page is found in this folder:
_data/sections.yml

To edit the front page text, edit this file:
index.md (in the root directory)

To add in social networking sites & buttons, open and edit the following file:
_includes/social.html # This is for the actual sites
_includes/social-footer.html # This is for the icons at the bottom of the page

Important:
Be sure to update line 15 of the _config.yml file to be the top-level
domain for the site. 

Outstanding TODOs:
- Sorted and URL included bib file for publications.
